# Face-detection-Recognition

## Face Detection:
Face detection is a computer vision problem that involves finding faces in photos.
## Face Recognition
Face recognition is the problem of identifying and verifying people in a photograph by their face.

### 1.1 Face detection in Image and real-time featured based using cascade classifier.ipynb
Face detection is a problem in computer vision of locating and localizing one or more faces in a photograph.
Locating a face in a photograph refers to finding the coordinate of the face in the image, whereas localization refers to demarcating the extent of the face, often via a bounding box around the face.
We can do the face-detection with two ways, one is Featured based using Cascade-Classifier and the other Deep-Learnin based using Muti-Task Cascade Convilutional Neural Network (MTCNN).
In the code file 1.1 I have done the faces detection in image and real time.

### 1.2 Face detection in image and real-time deep-learning based using mtcnn.ipynb
I have acheived perfect result with mtcnn thats why I have also done facial Landmark task in this file in image and also at real-time.

### 1.3 Extracting faces from images using mtcnn.ipynb
We can also extract the faces from images and then we can use it different system like authorization and verfication system
